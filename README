    A ramfs implemented with FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace), so that I can
learn a little about filesystem programming.

    Please DO NOT use this in an enviroment you care about, if you need
ideas look at Linux's ramfs or tmpfs which have the advantage of being
actual production filesystems and not someone's toy project created for
their own amusement and education.
