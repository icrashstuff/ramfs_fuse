    A ramfs implemented with FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace), so that I can
learn a little about filesystem programming.

    Please DO NOT use this in an environment you care about, if you need
ideas look at Linux's ramfs or tmpfs which have the advantage of being
actual production filesystems and not someone's toy project created for
their own amusement and education.

Building
--------
ramfs_fuse requires the following to build:
- CMake
- C99 compiler
- libfuse (optionally with statx(2) support)

$ cmake -B build .
$ make


Running
-------
$ cd build
$ ./ramfs [options] /path/to/mountpoint

Two options which you may find of some interest:
    --debug-ramfs  Enables all ramfs_fuse debug messages
    -f             Keeps ramfs_fuse in the foreground


Unmounting
----------
$ fusermount -u /path/to/mountpoint
or
$ umount /path/to/mountpoint
